Hello. I'm @sadsongco, or Nigel in the real world.
I'm a musician. Professional for a few decades, current status uncertain.
Writing this in early 2023, I graduated my Computer Science degree at Goldsmiths / University Of London with a first last year
I've written in PHP / MySQL / Javascript / CSS / HTML for many years in a self-taught capacity.
I suppose you could call me a full-stack developer, but to be at my best
I need to work with a designer - I prefer backend implementation, left to my own devices on a website
it will all end up black or Star Destroyer gray. Refined looking and professional, but my middle name
is not 'pizzazz'.
